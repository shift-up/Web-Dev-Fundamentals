# Mini-Project 0.1

This mini-project is meant to get you familiar with the assignment submission and feedback process using GitHub.com. This mini-project does not require any knowledge of Git or the command-line, it can all be completed using the user interface at GitHub.com. Make sure you complete the Module 0 course material before doing this assignment. You will use this same process to submit all Mini-Projects and Unit Projects going forward.

## Project Instructions

1. Go to https://github.com/shift-up/ and find the repository with your own name on it. Ex: `noah-passalacqua`

1. Create a new branch called `mini-project0.1`.

1. Create New File within this directory. ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shift-up/Web-Dev-Fundamentals/master/Unit1/Module0/Mini-Project0.1/screenshots/step3.png "Step 3")

1. Name the file `mini-project0.1.md`

1. Add a sentence or two to the file describing one thing you learned in Module 0. ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shift-up/Web-Dev-Fundamentals/master/Unit1/Module0/Mini-Project0.1/screenshots/step4.png "Step 4")

1. Scroll down and click the green "Commit new file" button. **IMPORTANT:** make sure you select "Commit directly to the `mini-project0.1` branch. ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shift-up/Web-Dev-Fundamentals/master/Unit1/Unit0-Project/screenshots/step5.png "Step 5")

1. Create a new pull request for the `mini-project0.1` branch you just created (same way you did in Module 0.1 of this course).

1. Select your coach as the reviewer (e.g. alaurenz or passabilities) ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shift-up/Web-Dev-Fundamentals/master/Unit1/Module0/Mini-Project0.1/screenshots/step7.png "Step 7")

1. Since this is a practice on using the assignment review system, the coach will reject the pull request (a.k.a. your "PR"), which may take them a day or two.

1. After you get a notice of the PR rejection (via email), make a change to update the PR (any change to the mini-project0.1.md file is fine). Then commit that change.

1. After committing the change, click the "re-request" review button on the PR. The coach will get notified and will Approve the PR within the next day or so. ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shift-up/Web-Dev-Fundamentals/master/Unit1/Module0/Mini-Project0.1/screenshots/step10.png "Step 10")

1. Finally, after coach approves your PR, merge it to master. ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shift-up/Web-Dev-Fundamentals/master/Unit1/Module0/Mini-Project0.1/screenshots/step11.png "Step 11")
